# Code of Conduct — SkillEd

SkillEd is a learning community. We welcome students, educators, mentors, and open-source contributors from every background. Our goal is to keep this space helpful, respectful, and focused on building great educational tools together.

This Code of Conduct sets expectations for behavior in all project spaces: GitHub issues/PRs/discussions, code reviews, documentation, community chats, and any related online or offline events.

---

## Our Pledge
We pledge to make participation in the SkillEd community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, ability, body size, caste, disability, education, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, neurotype, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We also recognize that SkillEd is used by learners. We therefore place extra emphasis on honesty, kindness, and clarity in all interactions.

## Our Standards

### Expected behavior

- Use inclusive language and assume good intent.
- Give and receive feedback gracefully; focus on what improves the project.
- Keep discussions on topic; move side conversations to appropriate channels.
- Credit sources, cite references, and respect licenses when using content or code.

### Unacceptable behavior
- Harassment, discrimination, or hateful conduct in any form.
- Insults, trolling, personal or political attacks, or sustained disruption.
- Unwanted sexual attention or imagery; sexualized language or jokes.
- Publishing others’ private information (doxing) without explicit permission.
- Spam, advertising, or repeatedly posting off-topic content.
- Academic misconduct: sharing exam/quiz answers, promoting cheating, or posting copyrighted course materials without permission.
- Any activity intended to bypass platform security, privacy, or fair-use boundaries.

## Scope
This Code applies across all SkillEd spaces and interactions:
- The GitHub organization/repositories, issues, PRs, and discussions.
- Community forums, chats, or calls organized by maintainers.
- Public interactions where you represent SkillEd or link back to the project.

## Reporting a Problem
If you witness or experience behavior that violates this Code, please report it:

- **Maintainers on GitHub:** [@Naga Laxmi]

Include links, screenshots, and context if possible. We will acknowledge receipt within **7 days**, keep reports confidential to the moderation team, and share only what is necessary to investigate and resolve the issue.

If you believe someone is in immediate danger, contact local authorities first.

---

## Enforcement
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing this Code. They may remove or edit comments, reject commits, revoke access, or impose temporary/permanent bans for behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, or harmful.

We may decline to engage with bad-faith or repetitive complaints that lack evidence or appear intended to derail conversations.

## Community Health and Academic Integrity
SkillEd exists to support learning. We do not permit:
